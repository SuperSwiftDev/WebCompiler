<prompt name="constraint-satisfaction">
    <message role="user">
You have five guests and only three chairs. One chair must go to the oldest guest. One must go to the person wearing red. The remaining chair can’t go to someone under 18.

Who gets the chairs?
    </message>
    <message-breakpoint role="assistant">
The three guests who get the chairs are:  
1. The oldest guest  
2. The guest wearing red  
3. An adult guest (18 or older) who is neither the oldest nor wearing red  
    </message-breakpoint>

    <message role="user">Show your logic.</message>
    <message-breakpoint role="assistant">
To satisfy the constraints:

- **Constraint 1**: One chair must go to the **oldest guest**.
- **Constraint 2**: One chair must go to the **guest wearing red**.
- **Constraint 3**: The third chair **must not** go to someone **under 18**.

Now, these categories might overlap. For example, the oldest guest might also be wearing red, or the guest in red might be under 18.

But based on what we know:
1. Assign a chair to the **oldest guest**.
2. Assign a chair to the **guest wearing red**.
3. For the third chair, **exclude any guest under 18** and also exclude anyone who already got a chair in step 1 or 2.

This guarantees:
- Each constraint is individually respected.
- No chair is assigned to someone under 18 for the third slot.
- Guests who satisfy multiple constraints still only occupy one chair.

Without specific identities, this is the most general solution that meets all rules.
    </message-breakpoint>

    <message role="user">If the guest in red is under 18, what happens?</message>
    <message-breakpoint role="assistant">
If the guest wearing red is **under 18**, that is still acceptable for the second chair because:

- The rule about age only applies to the **third** chair.
- The red-wearing guest is getting a chair because of what they’re wearing, **not their age**.

So the updated logic would be:
1. Chair 1 → Oldest guest  
2. Chair 2 → Guest wearing red (even if under 18)  
3. Chair 3 → An adult guest (not under 18), who is **neither** the oldest nor wearing red  

All constraints are satisfied.
