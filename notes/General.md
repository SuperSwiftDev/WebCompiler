What I'm doing with ContentML, in additional to the functionality as shown in [WebCompiler](https://github.com/SuperSwiftDev/WebCompiler), is basically building a smart system to embed the timeless principles of copywriting right into the markup in such a way that the copy writes itself in a very streamlined manner like a digital assistant trained in classic advertising, working quietly behind the scenes to shape persuasive, audience-aware content every time you compile.
